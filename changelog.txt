Legend:
 [+] - added feature

 [-] - removed feature


Version 3.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Negative energy values due to improper initialization (Visual Studio 2008 port)
  

Version 3.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * when you press the help button (F1) shows the tutorial.pdf
  * Fixed bug: when you click the exit button quits application

Version 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 + Ported x264 codec to Visual Studio 2008 (minor changes)
 + Merged Cycle Accurate Model Simulator with main trunk
 * Fixed bug: showing invalid number of points in "chk, chkfr" comments
   output of sharpinfo decompiler
 

Version 2.9.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Removed the "not equal instruction (cmpne)"
 * Fixed compare instructions and the jump instruction in order to be compatible with the
   hardware implementation. it works with #if, #while, #do-#while 

Version 2.9.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 + SharpInfo tool  reads the opcodes from the configuration file
 + Added new command mode(mvc, ref, partition), mode(1, 5, 8x16)
   which means execute the first instruction in the program with ref 5 and partition 8?16
   for each    motion vector candidate. Then execute the rest of the program with the winner.
   We updated the configuration.ini with new opcodes

Version 2.9.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 + reactivated the compare instructions
   #if( SAD == 10 ) {}
   #if( SAD > 20)  {}
   #if( SAD < 20)  {}
   #if( SAD >= 20)  {}
   #if( SAD <= 20)  {}
   #while( SAD > 10) {}
   #do {} #while(SAD > 10)

Version 2.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 * The new version fixed some bugs
 - Deactivated the compare instructions
 + Added Math functions log

Version 2.5.0

 + New Syntax for checking the winning point
 + Alternative syntax for checking the WINID #if(WINID == 1 ) {  }
 + New statement #break, exits a loop (running on embedded level)
 + Brand new Optimizer (modifies assembly, removing useless instructions)
 * Bug Fix for optimizer on patterns
 + New utillity “sharpinfo.exe” decompiles binary memory and program
 + New SharpEye analytics dialog showing the compiler’s result.


Version 2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 + New Assembly Optimizer
 + New Estimo C statement “check(1,0) -> { winning-block} ” execute a block of code based

 + Redundancy Check for the sub patterns, avoid to check points that it is absolutely
   certain that have been checked. [this operation is performed at Compile Time]
 + New reference manual at the download section
 + The compiler uses a configuration file where facilitates modification to the hardware
   prototype
